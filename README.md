## Introduction

:construction: This repo is a data fetching Library for vue3, which is highly inspired by [swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr).SWR is an amazing React Hooks library for data fetching.

## Why

There have been great data fetching library like vueuse etc. However, I want to make a library which can combine `store` with `data fetch`.

## Feartures

- [ ] error retry
- [ ] Manual fetch
- [ ] use every place but fetch once
- [ ] Typescript ready
- [ ] Transport and protocol agnostic
- [ ] Polling on interval
